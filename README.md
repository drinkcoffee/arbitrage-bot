# CrOsschain Dex AnalysiS (CODAS)

This project analyses Uniswap V3 Liqudity Pools on separate chains and provides guidance on how to balance the pools so that they have the same exchange rate.

The project is work in progress and is being developed as a side project. As such, expect things not to work, to unexpectly change, and to not be well documented. This will all improve with time.
